The Structuralist,"Speaking Fluently for TOEFL Speaking Question 1 (Independent Task - e.g., giving an opinion)",Great to meet you too! My main goal is to score at least 105 on the TOEFL. I'm especially focused on the speaking and writing sections since I need strong scores for my graduate school applications.,"I feel fairly confident overall. I can understand lectures and academic texts pretty well, but I still want to polish my writing and make sure my speaking sounds more natural and fluent, especially under time pressure.","I'm honestly a bit nervous. It feels like a big challenge, especially because of the time limits and pressure. But I'm motivated to put in the work and improve—I just need some guidance and practice.",Beginner,Needs Foundational Support,"Student starts speaking but hesitates frequently after the first few words, using many filler words like 'um' and 'uh'.","Given the student's beginner level and frequent hesitations, a highly structured template will provide a framework to organize their thoughts and reduce the cognitive load during speaking. This addresses the fluency issue directly by providing pre-planned sentence structures and vocabulary.",Sentence Starter and Structure Template,template,Opinion Statement Template,"{""fields"": [{""label"": ""Opinion Statement:"", ""placeholder"": ""I believe that... / In my opinion... / I think that...""}, {""label"": ""Reason 1 Introduction:"", ""placeholder"": ""Firstly, ... / To begin with, ... / One reason is that...""}, {""label"": ""Reason 1 Explanation:"", ""placeholder"": ""This is because... / This means that... / For example...""}, {""label"": ""Reason 2 Introduction:"", ""placeholder"": ""Secondly, ... / Another reason is... / In addition, ...""}, {""label"": ""Reason 2 Explanation:"", ""placeholder"": ""This is because... / This means that... / For instance...""}, {""label"": ""Concluding Statement:"", ""placeholder"": ""Therefore, ... / For these reasons, ... / In conclusion, ...""}]}","Alright, let's tackle this fluency issue head-on. We're going to use a structured template to organize your thoughts *before* you start speaking. This will give you a clear roadmap and reduce those 'um's and 'uh's. I'm providing you with a sentence starter and structure template. It's like a fill-in-the-blanks exercise for your speech.","Before you start speaking, take a few seconds to fill in the blanks in this template with your ideas. Focus on simple, clear reasons. Don't worry about being perfect; just get the basic structure down. Then, when the timer starts, read through the template, expanding on each point as you go. Remember to speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Don't rush!","I'll be listening closely for how well you use the template. If you still hesitate a lot, I'll ask you to pause and identify which part of the template is causing you trouble. We'll then break that section down further. If you use it well, I'll ask you to focus on adding more detail to each section while maintaining the structure.","In the next task, I'll provide a simplified template with only the main headings (Opinion, Reason 1, Reason 2, Conclusion). The student will then need to generate the sentence starters and explanations themselves, gradually reducing reliance on the full template.","Given the student's nervousness, I'll emphasize that this template is a tool to *help* them, not a rigid constraint. I'll use a calm and encouraging tone, reminding them that it's okay to make mistakes and that the goal is to improve gradually. I will also explicitly state that the template is designed to reduce pressure, not increase it."

We're going to use a structured template to organize your thoughts *before* you start speaking. This will give you a clear roadmap and reduce those 'um's and 'uh's. I call it the Opinion-Reason-Example (ORE) Template. It's simple, but powerful. We'll fill it out *before* you speak.","Before the timer starts, quickly jot down keywords or phrases for each section of the template based on the question. Focus on clarity, not perfection. Then, when the timer begins, use the sentence starters provided as a springboard to expand on your notes. Don't deviate from the structure. Stick to the plan. The goal is to speak smoothly and logically, not to be perfectly original.","I will listen carefully to the student's response, noting where they adhere to the template and where they deviate or hesitate. If they still struggle, I'll provide specific feedback on which part of the template is causing difficulty and offer more targeted sentence starters or vocabulary. If they use it well, I'll ask them to reflect on how the template helped and what they found most useful.","In the next iteration, I will remove the sentence starters from the template, leaving only the labels (Opinion, Reason 1, Example, etc.). This will encourage the student to generate their own phrases while still maintaining the overall structure. Eventually, the template itself will be removed, and the student will be expected to internalize the ORE structure.","Given the student's nervousness, I will emphasize that this template is a tool to *reduce* pressure, not add to it. I'll frame it as a safety net and reassure them that it's okay to rely on it heavily at first. My tone will be direct but encouraging, focusing on the practical benefits of the structure."
