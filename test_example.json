  "incorrect_version": "Traditions are good. They are very old things. My family has many old things we do every year. Like, we eat big food on holiday. It is a fat food. I think it is important to keep old things because they are strong. New things are weak. So, old things are best.",
  "thought_process": "The student is struggling with connotation. The word 'fat' has a negative connotation, implying unhealthy or undesirable. While the food might be high in calories, a more neutral or positive word like 'rich' or 'special' would be better. The student also uses 'strong' and 'weak' to describe traditions and new things. While the intent is to convey resilience and fragility, these words have a more literal, physical connotation. 'Important' or 'valuable' would be better choices for traditions, and 'easily changed' or 'new' would be better for new things. The phrase 'old things' is repeated and sounds a bit clunky; varying the vocabulary slightly would improve the flow.",
  "correct_version": "Traditions are good. They are very old customs. My family has many old customs we do every year. Like, we eat big food on holidays. It is a rich food. I think it is important to keep old customs because they are valuable. New things are easily changed. So, old customs are best.",
